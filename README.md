## Auto Email Replies using Gmail API and Node.js

### Local Setup

I highly recommend you to use pnpm over npm but it works with both of the package managers, pnpm is just faster that npm.

### Installation

Clone or Fork the repo

```bash
cd auto-replies
pnpm install
```

### Credentials

You also need Credentials to obtain that simple follow this guide from google https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials

Once you have generated your credentials.json file put it into the root directory i.e. auto-replies/

```
{
  "web": {
    "client_id": "REPLACE WITH YOURS",
    "project_id": "REPLACE WITH YOURS",
    "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
    "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
    "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
    "client_secret": "REPLACE WITH YOURS",
    "redirect_uris": [
      "http://localhost:3000/oauth2callback",
      "https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Start

To Start simple run command

```bash
pnpm run start
```

By default, the port is set to `8888` So, Visit http://localhost:8888 in your browser or API testing tool and allow the permissions on popup by Google. That's all.

Rest of the work app will do on it's own.

### Areas where it can improve

- Using Typescript for development, would make the development process faster and safer
- We can implement a Queue to keep track of the emails for pending replies, in case if the server crashes.
- Running Auto-Reply program in some scheduled time.
- Usage of AI to compose better replies.
- UI for customers
- The code itself can be refactored into different modules, using .env for environment variables, and 3rd party packages like nodemailer, axios
- logging logs, handling async operations in try-catch blocks, and implementing unique edge cases
